The scripts in this package is intenned to use for Amplicon Metagenome Analysis with MOTHUR workflow
In this workflow one can analyse amplicon metagenomic data from raw Illumina PE reads up to taxa abundance and richness tables

Script files in this package:
cutadapt_script* : scrips to trim target specific primer sequences from raw Illumina PE reads
mothur_init* : MOTHUR batch scripts to initiate MOTHUR pipeline with target specific parameters
mothur_pipeline* : main MOTHUR pipeline batch script with MOTHUR workflow commands
mothur_krona_XML_gy.py : python script to convert tax.summary.table to xml format can be used to generate krona diagram

## Recent MOTHUR workflow control files can be found in 
/mnt/00F68F456EE8961F/BioInfo/09_Softwares/MOTHUR_control/00_Recent


## USAGE

- Prepare your folder and input files
	- create a project folder
	- copy or move raw Illumna PE sequencing fastq.gz output files into your project folder
	- copy or link
		cutadapt_script
		mothur_init
		mothur_pipeline
		mothur_krona_XML_gy.py
			files into your project folder
- Run cutadapt scrtipt
	$ cutadapt_script_ILMN_16SV3V4_V02.sh ./
		The script will 
		- create fq_in and cut_out folders,
	 	- move all *fastq.gz files into fq_in folder
		- run cutadapt that outputs trimmed reads into cut_out folder
- Check MOTHUR pipeline parameters in the mothur_init file, set parameters if necessary. Start mothur and run script
	(activate conda environment with mothur installed, if necessary)
	$ mothur
	> mothur_init_MATE_16SV3V4_HP-DL-G10_V0.2.batch
		The script will help mothur to import the parameters and
		initiate the mothur_pipeline batch script
